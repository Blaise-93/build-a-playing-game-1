# Scrimba Course
the project aim is to build a game app whereby either a wizard wins or orc wins and/or the both dies with a progress health bar. It has other functionality btw. 

This is part of my javascript course at Scrimba on handling a lot of javascript/css methods like reduce(), map(), forEach(), deconstructor, constructor, arrow function and many more.

Thanks for checking out! :D
